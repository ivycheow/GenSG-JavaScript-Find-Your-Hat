## Find Your Hat 

## Overview
This is a command-line based game where the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes. The player must navigate through the field without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field to reach the hat.

## How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Type the command "node main.js" to start the game.
5. Follow the prompts to input the height and width of the game field respectively.
6. Once the game starts, you will see a randomly generated field based on the specified height and width with a hat ('^') and holes ('O') scattered around. Your character is represented by an asterisk ('*') and you must move it through the field by using key "U", "D", "L", "R" (up, down, left, right) to find the hat without falling into a hole or moving outside of the field. The field is represented by a grid of Field characters ('â–‘').
7. If you successfully find the hat, you win the game. If you fall into a hole or move outside of the field, you lose the game. If you decided to quit the game halfway through, you may do so by pressing key "Q" (quit).
